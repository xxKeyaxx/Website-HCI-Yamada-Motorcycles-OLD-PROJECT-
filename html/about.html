        <h3 class="subTitle2">Our Story</h3>
	    <p class="description2">Yamada's story began when our founder, Mr. Torakusu Yamada opened a humble repair workshop in 1977. He had always been fascinated by motorcycles and it's mechanisms. The idea of opening a workshop occured to him when one of his friends had commisioned him to repair his motorcycle, and after seeing his handiwork, jokingly suggested that he open a motorcycle repair workshop. We have since grown to be a family business with several branches all over Indonesia. However, since then our commitment on service has not changed. We have been providing quality products and services to our customers for decades. We are proud to be a part of the Yamada Motorcycles family.</p>
