# Website-HCI-Yamada-Motorcycles-OLD-PROJECT-
My first fully-fledged front-end-only website project. I did it for my second-semester university final project. It's simple and built with only pure HTML and CSS. Consider it a design for a motorcycle store named Yamada (definitely not Yamaha *cough cough*).

# How to Run
Just open any of the html files in the html folder and start exploring :)
